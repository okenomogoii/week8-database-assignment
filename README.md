# week8-database-assignment
## Project Overview

This project is part of the Week 8 database assignment, focusing on designing, implementing, and querying a relational database. The goal is to enhance understanding of database concepts, including schema design, normalization, and SQL queries.

## Features

- **Database Schema Design**: Create a well-structured schema for the given problem domain.
- **Data Normalization**: Ensure the database adheres to normalization principles to reduce redundancy.
- **SQL Queries**: Write and execute SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement constraints to maintain data consistency.

## Technologies Used

- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: [Specify the DBMS used, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite].
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for database operations.
- **Tools**: [List any tools used, e.g., pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench].

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/week8-database-assignment.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd week8-database-assignment
    ```
3. Import the database schema into your DBMS.
4. Run the provided SQL scripts to populate the database with sample data.

## Usage

- Use the SQL scripts in the `queries` folder to perform various operations on the database.
- Modify the scripts or write new ones to explore additional functionality.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of relational database design.
- Practice writing efficient SQL queries.
- Gain hands-on experience with a DBMS.
